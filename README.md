# jira-reporter

This Java/FX application gathers all Ready To Test and Done JIRA tasks from a given SCRUM board for a given assignee, forms a report and sends it in emails to a recipients list.

Currently I use Mailgun as email service. But any other can be used - just fork and modify, or prepare a patch for current repository.

I created this utility for my own needs, but if you need this - take it and use or modify.
