# jira-reporter

This Java/FX application gathers all *'Ready To Test'* and *'Done'* Atlassian JIRA tasks, from a given SCRUM board for a given assignee, creates a report and sends the report to a recipients list.

Currently I use Mailgun as email service.

This utility have been created for my own needs, but if you need this - take it and use or modify if needed.
